Add a new code chunk to create a basic ggplot2 column graph (with geom_col) showing the change in domestic graduate enrollment (y-axis: domestic_enrollment) from 2008 - 2019 (x-axis: year_abbr), with the fill color dependent on race/ethnicity. Do not update / finalize the graph further - this is what you will both work on in the next steps.
